Dr. John Snow carried out the investigation of this outbreak. Click on the [![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/PHI-Case-Studies/1854-Cholera-Outbreak-London-Basic/master) or [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/PHI-Case-Studies/1854-Cholera-Outbreak-London-Basic) link above. Wait a few minutes for the binder or Azure notebook service to complete its setup and launch. Enjoy the rest of the story after you launch the case study.

## Notes
### Using BinderHub
After clicking on the "launch binder" link above, wait for a few minutes to have Docker container built. 

### Using Microsoft Azure Notebook
This service is continuously being improved so notebooks and launch process might break. After launching a notebook or terminal, you may see a popup window that looks like the one below. It means the Jupyter Notebook container has not completed its set up yet. When the popup window to disappears, this means all the packages have been installed.
